Refund policy
We operate a 30-day returns policy, allowing you a month after receiving your item to request a return.

To qualify for a return, your item must be in the same condition in which you received it – unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. Additionally, you'll need to provide the receipt or proof of purchase.

To initiate a return, you can reach out to us at ahoy@bongzimmer.wtf.

Once your return is approved, we will send you a return shipping label along with instructions on how and where to send your package. Please note that we cannot accept items sent back to us without prior return request.

For any queries regarding returns, feel free to contact us at ahoy@bongzimmer.wtf.

**Damages and Issues**

Upon receiving your order, please inspect it carefully. If the item is defective, damaged, or you've received the wrong item, kindly get in touch with us immediately. This will allow us to assess the issue and rectify it promptly.

**Exceptions / Non-returnable Items**

Certain items fall under categories that cannot be returned. This includes perishable goods such as food, flowers, or plants, custom products like special orders or personalized items, and personal care goods such as beauty products. Additionally, we are unable to accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or gases. If you have any concerns about specific items, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Please note that sale items, gift cards, or NFTs cannot be returned.

**Right of Withdrawal for NFT Purchases**

Purchasing NFTs is a relatively new phenomenon gaining popularity. This raises questions about the right of withdrawal for such purchases. According to § 356 V BGB, there is generally a right of withdrawal when purchasing an NFT. However, there is an exception: if the NFT is delivered in digital form and the seller has indicated this, the buyer cannot withdraw from the purchase contract. This means that upon receiving the NFT, you do not have the right to a refund. Some sellers might offer different terms and allow the buyer to cancel the NFT purchase. In such cases, it's recommended to carefully review the conditions and terms before entering into the contract. Additionally, note that in Germany, only consumers are entitled to exercise the right of withdrawal. This means that businesses or investors do not have a claim for reimbursement.

**Exchanges**

For a quick resolution, the best way to secure the item you desire is to return the original item. Once the return is approved, you can make a separate purchase for the new item.

**European Union 14-Day Cooling Off Period**

In addition to the above, if the merchandise is being shipped to the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, without providing any reason. The same conditions apply: the item must be in the same condition as received – unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. A receipt or proof of purchase is also required.

**Refunds**

Upon receiving and inspecting your return, we will notify you about the approval of the refund. If approved, the refund will be automatically processed back to your original payment method within 10 business days. Please keep in mind that it may take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund as well. If more than 15 business days have passed since the approval of your return, kindly reach out to us at ahoy@bongzimmer.wtf.
